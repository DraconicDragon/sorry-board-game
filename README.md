# "Sorry!" board game (GER: Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht)

made this because i hated my friend's way of coding, not saying that mine is better, of course

### TODO:
- [ ] Implement piece selection on moving pieces on board
- [ ] Allow player to reroll after rolling a 6
- [ ] Switch player on turn end
  - [ ] Switch to next player if previous player could not roll a 6 with all his pieces in home
